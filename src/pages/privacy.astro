      <p class="text-text-secondary !mb-8"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 17, 2026</p>

      <p>TradeStudio ("we," "us," or "our") operates the TradeStudio website (tradestudio.com) and the TradeStudio desktop application (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our Services.</p>

      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell your personal information. We do not share, access, or use your custom indicators, trading strategies, prompts, or analytical work product — that content belongs to you.</p>

      <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our Services, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and Contact Information.</strong> If you create an account, join a waitlist, subscribe to updates, or contact us, we may collect your name, email address, and any other information you voluntarily provide.</li>
        <li><strong>API Keys.</strong> The TradeStudio desktop application requires you to enter API keys for third-party services. These keys are stored locally on your device in a configuration file. We do not transmit your API keys to TradeStudio servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Support and Correspondence.</strong> If you contact us for support, we collect the content of your messages, your email address, and any attachments you provide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically via the Website</h3>
      <p>When you visit our website, we collect certain information automatically through cookies and analytics tools.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data.</strong> Pages visited, time spent on pages, referring URLs, click-through behavior, and general navigation patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and Browser Information.</strong> Browser type and version, operating system, screen resolution, language preference, and device type.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Information.</strong> IP address (which may be anonymized depending on your cookie consent choices) and approximate geographic location derived from IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookie Data.</strong> See Section 5 (Cookies and Tracking Technologies) for details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.3 Information Collected by the Desktop Application</h3>
      <p>The TradeStudio desktop application is designed to operate primarily on your local machine. Here is what happens with your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Trading Data and Work Product.</strong> Your charts, indicators, strategies, drawing objects, alerts, workspaces, trade logs, and custom scripts are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store this information on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Feature Data.</strong> When you use AI-powered features (AI Chat, Strategy Lab, Earnings Narrative Backtest, Narrative Strategy Backtest), the application sends relevant data directly from your device to the AI provider's API servers to generate responses. This data may include OHLCV price data, indicator values, strategy parameters, and your natural-language prompts. This data is sent directly to the AI provider under your own API key. TradeStudio does not route, intercept, store, or have access to these communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Data Requests.</strong> When you load chart data, the application sends requests directly from your device to the data provider you have selected (Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io, AlphaVantage, or Financial Modeling Prep). These requests include the ticker symbol and timeframe you are viewing. TradeStudio does not proxy or store these requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Cached Predictions.</strong> AI prediction results from the Narrative Strategy Backtest are cached locally on your device to avoid redundant API calls. This cache remains on your device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1.4 Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your brokerage credentials or financial account information.</li>
        <li>We do not collect your trading positions, portfolio holdings, or order history.</li>
        <li>We do not access, collect, or store the content of your custom indicators, strategies, prompts, or any other work product you create within the application.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Providing and Maintaining the Services.</strong> To operate the website, process waitlist signups, deliver software updates, and provide customer support.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Improvement.</strong> To understand how users interact with our website so we can improve the design, content, and functionality of our Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications.</strong> To respond to your inquiries, send product updates, and deliver information you have requested. You may opt out of marketing communications at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention.</strong> To detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents, fraud, or technical issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> To comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use your information for automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects on you.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>
      <p>We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics Providers.</strong> We share website usage data with analytics providers to analyze site traffic and usage patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may engage service providers who assist in operating our website (such as hosting providers, email delivery services, or customer support tools). These providers are contractually required to use your information only to perform services on our behalf and to maintain appropriate security measures.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements.</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of TradeStudio, our users, or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If TradeStudio is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change by updating this Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

      <h3>5.1 What Are Cookies?</h3>
      <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your web browser when you visit a website. They help the website recognize your device and remember certain information about your visit.</p>

      <h3>5.2 How We Use Cookies</h3>
      <p>Our website uses the following categories of cookies:</p>
      <p><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong> — These cookies are essential for the website to function and cannot be switched off. They are usually set in response to actions you take, such as setting your cookie consent preferences. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>
      <p><strong>Analytics Cookies</strong> — We may use analytics tools to understand how visitors interact with our website. The information collected includes pages visited, session duration, bounce rates, general geographic region, and device/browser information. We do not link analytics data to any personally identifiable information.</p>

      <h3>5.3 Your Cookie Choices</h3>
      <p>When you first visit our website, you will be presented with a cookie consent banner that allows you to accept or decline analytics cookies. You can change your cookie preferences at any time through the cookie settings link in the website footer.</p>
      <p>If you decline analytics cookies, tracking will not be activated and no analytics cookies will be placed on your device.</p>
