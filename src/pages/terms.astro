      <h2>5. API Keys and Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Bring Your Own Keys</h3>
      <p>The TradeStudio desktop application requires you to provide your own API keys for certain third-party services in order to use specific features. These third-party services include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Provider</strong> — for AI-powered features (AI Chat, Strategy Lab, Earnings Narrative Backtest, Narrative Strategy Backtest)</li>
        <li><strong>Polygon.io</strong> — for premium market data</li>
        <li><strong>AlphaVantage</strong> — for market data</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)</strong> — for earnings transcripts, calendar data, and market data</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 Your Responsibility for API Keys</h3>
      <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtaining, maintaining, and paying for your own API keys from these third-party providers.</li>
        <li>Complying with the terms of service, usage policies, and rate limits of each third-party provider.</li>
        <li>Securing your API keys. TradeStudio stores your API keys locally on your device and does not transmit them to TradeStudio servers.</li>
        <li>Any charges, fees, or costs incurred through your use of third-party APIs, including charges for AI model usage (e.g., API token consumption).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.3 Third-Party Service Relationships</h3>
      <p>TradeStudio is not a party to your agreements with third-party API providers. We do not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for the availability, accuracy, or reliability of any third-party service. When you use features that connect to third-party APIs, data is transmitted directly from your device to the third-party provider. TradeStudio does not act as an intermediary, proxy, or processor for these communications.</p>
      <p>Your use of each third-party service is governed by that provider's own terms of service and privacy policy. We encourage you to review them.</p>

      <h3>5.4 Changes to Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>Third-party providers may change their APIs, pricing, terms, or availability at any time. TradeStudio is not responsible for disruptions, changes, or discontinuation of third-party services, and such changes do not entitle you to a refund of any fees paid to TradeStudio.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>6. AI-Powered Features</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Description of AI Features</h3>
      <p>TradeStudio integrates AI capabilities powered by large language models. AI-powered features include the AI Chat Assistant, Strategy Lab, Earnings Narrative Backtest, Narrative Strategy Backtest, and AI-assisted code generation. These features generate outputs including, but not limited to, text analysis, trading strategies, C# source code, market predictions, and natural-language commentary ("AI Outputs").</p>

      <h3>6.2 AI Outputs Are Not Investment Advice</h3>
      <p><strong>AI Outputs are generated by a third-party AI model and are provided for informational, educational, and research purposes only. AI Outputs do not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading recommendations, or any other form of professional advice.</strong></p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, misleading, or otherwise unreliable.</li>
        <li>AI Outputs are based on historical data and statistical patterns and do not predict or guarantee future market behavior.</li>
        <li>AI-generated strategies, predictions, and analyses have not been reviewed or approved by any licensed financial professional.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and suitability of any AI Output before relying on it for any purpose.</li>
        <li>You will not rely on AI Outputs as the sole or primary basis for any trading or investment decision.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.3 AI Output Ownership</h3>
      <p>As between you and TradeStudio, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own any AI Outputs generated through your use of the Services using your own API keys and inputs. However, you acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI Outputs are generated by a third-party model, and the AI provider's terms govern its processing of your inputs and outputs.</li>
        <li>Similar or identical AI Outputs may be generated for other users who provide similar inputs.</li>
        <li>AI Outputs may not be eligible for copyright protection under current law, as courts and the U.S. Copyright Office have generally required meaningful human authorship for copyright eligibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.4 AI Model Limitations</h3>
      <p>You acknowledge that AI models may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Produce outputs that are factually incorrect ("hallucinations").</li>
        <li>Generate code that contains bugs, errors, or security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Exhibit biases present in training data.</li>
        <li>Produce different outputs for the same inputs at different times.</li>
        <li>Be subject to changes, updates, or discontinuation by the AI provider at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TradeStudio does not control the underlying AI model and makes no representations or warranties regarding the quality, accuracy, safety, or fitness for purpose of AI Outputs.</p>

      <h3>6.5 Prediction Caching</h3>
      <p>AI prediction results from the Narrative Strategy Backtest are cached locally on your device to minimize redundant API calls. This cached data remains on your device and is not transmitted to TradeStudio. You are responsible for the security and management of cached data on your device.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>7. Market Data</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Data Sources</h3>
      <p>The Services allow you to access market data from multiple providers, including Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io, AlphaVantage, Financial Modeling Prep, and local CSV files. Market data is provided by these third-party sources, not by TradeStudio.</p>

      <h3>7.2 Data Accuracy</h3>
      <p>TradeStudio does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability, or availability of any market data displayed in the Services. Market data may contain errors, omissions, or delays. You are responsible for verifying any data before relying on it for trading or investment decisions.</p>

      <h3>7.3 Data Use Restrictions</h3>
      <p>Your use of market data obtained through the Services is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable data provider. You may not redistribute, resell, or sublicense market data obtained through the Services unless expressly permitted by the data provider's terms.</p>

      <h3>7.4 Display-Only Use</h3>
      <p>Market data displayed within TradeStudio is provided for display and personal research purposes only. You may not use market data obtained through the Services for automated trading, order generation, price referencing, or any other non-display use unless permitted by the applicable data provider's terms.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>8. Strategy Backtesting and Hypothetical Performance</h2>

      <h3>8.1 Hypothetical Results</h3>
      <p>The backtesting features of the Services, including the Strategy Lab, Earnings Narrative Backtest, Narrative Strategy Backtest, and custom strategy evaluation, produce hypothetical performance results. <strong>Hypothetical performance results have significant inherent limitations.</strong></p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hypothetical results do not represent actual trading. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.</li>
        <li>Hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. No hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.</li>
        <li>Hypothetical results are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight and may not account for market conditions that would affect actual trading, including liquidity, slippage, commissions, fees, and market impact.</li>
        <li>There are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.</li>
        <li>Numerous factors related to the markets or to the implementation of any specific trading strategy cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results, and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8.2 Past Performance</h3>
      <p><strong>Past performance, whether actual or hypothetical, does not guarantee future results.</strong> The results of any backtest, strategy, prediction, or analysis produced by the Services should not be interpreted as an indication of future performance.</p>

      <h3>8.3 Look-Ahead Bias</h3>
      <p>While TradeStudio's built-in indicators and strategies are designed as stateless pure functions to minimize look-ahead bias, and the application includes retrospective detection to flag potential look-ahead bias in custom scripts, no automated system can guarantee the elimination of all bias. You are responsible for understanding the limitations of backtesting and evaluating whether results are realistic.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>9. Custom Scripting and User-Generated Content</h2>

      <h3>9.1 Custom Indicators and Strategies</h3>
      <p>TradeStudio includes a scripting engine that allows you to create custom indicators and trading strategies using C#. You may also generate code through AI features.</p>

      <h3>9.2 Ownership of Your Code</h3>
      <p>You retain all intellectual property rights in custom indicators, strategies, scripts, and other content that you create ("User Content"). TradeStudio does not claim ownership of your User Content. We do not access, collect, or store your User Content on our servers. Your scripts and custom code are stored locally on your device.</p>

      <h3>9.3 Your Responsibility for User Content</h3>
      <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accuracy, quality, legality, and safety of any custom indicators, strategies, or scripts you create or use.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that your User Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.</li>
        <li>Evaluating and testing any AI-generated code before relying on it for analysis or trading decisions. AI-generated code may contain errors, bugs, or unintended behavior.</li>
        <li>Understanding that custom scripts execute within the application's runtime environment and that errors in your code may cause incorrect analysis results or application instability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.4 Code Compilation</h3>
      <p>TradeStudio compiles custom scripts and AI-generated code in-process using the Roslyn C# compiler. Compiled code runs within the application and has access to TradeStudio's indicator and strategy APIs. You understand that running custom or AI-generated code is inherently risky and that you do so at your own risk.</p>

      <hr />
